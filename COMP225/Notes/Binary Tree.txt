Binary Tree

Definition for binary tree T
1. T is empty
2. T is not empty and
	a) Exactly 1 node is the root
	b) All other nodes are divided into two disjoint subsets called the
	   left subtree and the right subtree (both of which are trees)

Height of a tree
H(T) = 0 if T is empty
H(T) = 1 + maximum(H(Tl), H(Tr)) 

N nodes in the tree
height is log(N)

balanced tree
difference in height of subtrees of all nodes must be at least 1
(must be full on every level except the last)

Tree Traversal
pre-order: ABCDEF (for tree in that order)
ACBDEF

post order: FEDCBA (for tree in order ABCDEF)

inorder: DBEACF (left subtree, root, right subtree)

depth first: ACFBED (go all the way down first, then go back and repeat)

breadth first traversal: ABCDEF (read like a book)
