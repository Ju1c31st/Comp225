Bucket Sort

1. Create a bucket for each category
2. Scan the list and increment a counter in the bucket for each corresponding category
3. Go through each bucket and overwrite the appropriate amount for each bucket

categories : {0, 1, 2, 3}

A = {1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2}

Bucket = {0, 0, 0, 0}
after counting members of A

Bucket = {3, 2, 3, 2}

A = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3}

Worst Case Time Complexity
O(n + n)
= O(n)
